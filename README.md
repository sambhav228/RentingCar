## Problem Statements:

In order to implement this, they need an interface for customers so that they can get a rental in a simple way without direct interaction. For this the customer should provide his Aadhar card, pan card and driving license. After confirmation of this information the customer must be able to view the menu of cars and choose any one of it for rental purpose. 

**Conditions:** 
1. The pan number should consist of 10 digits. First 5 digits and the last digit should consist of alphabets and the rest should be numbers.
